# Why this?

We've all been there before.. Juggling between email sequences for your newletters and promotions; while creating landing pages to your website blog with the samething. You're going back and forth; copying and pasting.. while fussing with the formatting.

This sucks.

Not only is your workflow choppy and leads to inconsitent results, but its also costing your most valuable asset, your time!

## Solution

What you really need, is a way to consolidate these workflows between email broadcasts and website updates. That's why me and my team have worked to implement RSS blog updates directly into a CRM.

Once you published your blog, an email is send to all your blog subscribers on your CRM platform.

# Overview

This service delivers blog posts, also known as RSS updates, to a list of CRM subscribers.

## Core Components

The service relies on several core components for its operation:

*   **Automations:**
    *   An Opt-in process to manage new subscriber additions.
    *   An Opt-out process to handle user unsubscribes.
    *   A Broadcast process responsible for dispatching the final email.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   User-facing pages for both opt-in and opt-out functionalities.
*   **Email & Data Fields:**
    *   The primary email template for the forwarded RSS updates, which is dynamically managed by the integration.
    *   A contact tag used to initiate the email broadcast.
    *   A contact field to track the specific email list subscription type.
*   **Integration:**
    *   An external automation platform that monitors the RSS feed for new content and orchestrates the entire broadcast process.

## Broadcast Process Summary

The high-level steps for broadcasting a blog update are:

*   **Initiation**: The process is triggered automatically when a new update is detected on the RSS feed.
*   **Template Preparation**: The integration service fetches the new RSS content and dynamically updates the stored email template.
*   **Subscriber Identification**: The system queries the contact database to identify all current subscribers.
*   **Broadcast Trigger**: Subscribers are tagged, which activates the final email broadcast automation within the marketing platform.
*   **Email Dispatch**: The updated RSS email is sent out to the tagged contacts.
*   **Process Completion**: The tag is then automatically removed from the contacts, making them ready for the next update.
