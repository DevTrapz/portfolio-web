# Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The **Blog Update Forwarding Service** is a custom technical solution designed to automate the delivery of RSS blog updates to email subscribers. By bridging the gap between a standard RSS feed and a CRM's broadcast engine, this system eliminates the need for manual email creation and third-party middleware.

## Background

Currently, **Brand Financial Training** manages their email communications across two disconnected platforms:
* **Main CRM:** Handles all newsletters and promotional campaigns.
* **MailChimp:** Used exclusively for automated blog post notifications.

### The Challenge

Operating two separate systems has created fragmented data and unnecessary overhead. The team aims to consolidate all email marketing into their primary CRM to reduce software licensing costs and centralize subscriber management. 

However, the primary CRM lacks a native "RSS-to-Email" feature, creating a technical barrier to decommissioning MailChimp.


## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build an integration layer that monitors the website’s RSS feed and triggers an automated broadcast within the primary CRM. 

**The desired outcome:** When a new blog post is published, an email is automatically generated and dispatched to the synchronized subscriber list, allowing Brand Financial Training to fully migrate away from MailChimp without losing automated functionality.

## Key Benefits
* **Cost Reduction:** Eliminates the monthly expense of a secondary email service provider (MailChimp).
* **Centralized Data:** Maintains a single "Source of Truth" for all student and subscriber data within one CRM.
* **Workflow Efficiency:** Removes the need to manage templates and lists across multiple platforms.

## Core Components

The service relies on several core components for its operation:

*   **Automations:**
    *   An Opt-in process to manage new subscriber additions.
    *   An Opt-out process to handle user unsubscribes.
    *   A Broadcast process responsible for dispatching the final email.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   User-facing pages for both opt-in and opt-out functionalities.
*   **Email & Data Fields:**
    *   The primary email template for the forwarded RSS updates, which is dynamically managed by the integration.
    *   A contact tag used to initiate the email broadcast.
    *   A contact field to track the specific email list subscription type.
*   **Integration:**
    *   An external automation platform that monitors the RSS feed for new content and orchestrates the entire broadcast process.

## Broadcast Process Summary

The high-level steps for broadcasting a blog update are:

*   **Initiation**: The process is triggered automatically when a new update is detected on the RSS feed.
*   **Template Preparation**: The integration service fetches the new RSS content and dynamically updates the stored email template.
*   **Subscriber Identification**: The system queries the contact database to identify all current subscribers.
*   **Broadcast Trigger**: Subscribers are tagged, which activates the final email broadcast automation within the marketing platform.
*   **Email Dispatch**: The updated RSS email is sent out to the tagged contacts.
*   **Process Completion**: The tag is then automatically removed from the contacts, making them ready for the next update.
