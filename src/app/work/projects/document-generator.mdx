# Project Overview

## Background
The **Centre for Intuitive Education** currently utilizes a legacy document generation system that is overly complex, unreliable, and unsupported. The current technical stack relies on a fragile chain of Zapier, Google Sheets, and custom scripts to evaluate and load student data fields.

### Current Pain Points:
* **System Instability:** Frequent loading failures have created a frustrating experience for both students and course instructors.
* **Lack of Support:** The original maintainers are unresponsive, leaving the institution unable to troubleshoot or update the critical document generator.
* **Workflow Friction:** Students are often unable to view or print their progress, which is a vital part of their educational journey.

## The Solution
To resolve these issues, we will develop a high-performance **React/TypeScript** web application. This application will serve as a dedicated rendering engine that displays student progress documents instantly and provides robust download options, bypassing the need for third-party automation tools.


## Project Requirements

The new generator is built to be:
* **High-Fidelity Rendering:** Accurately reflects the original document's layout and professional branding.
* **Dynamic Data Integration:** Seamlessly consumes and displays data specific to the student accessing the page.
* **Exportable:** Features a reliable "Download as PNG" function for offline storage and printing.
* **High Availability:** A serverless, static architecture ensures the service is always available for students and teachers.

## Core Components & Technology Stack

The service utilizes the following infrastructure:

### **Frontend & Logic**
* **React / TypeScript:** Powers the UI and handles conditional logic to evaluate data fields based on student inputs.
* **Once UI:** A code-first design system to ensure a professional, responsive, and accessible user interface.

### **Hosting & Deployment**
* **GitHub Pages:** Provides a secure, zero-cost hosting solution for static assets.
* **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** Automates the pipeline—triggering a fresh build and deployment every time changes are pushed to the production branch.

### **Integration Layer**
* **Ontraport iFrame:** The application is embedded directly within the Ontraport environment.
* **Query Parameters:** Student data is passed securely from Ontraport to the React app via URL parameters, allowing for instant, script-free data population.

## Development Roadmap
1.  **UI Design:** Replicate the document layout within Figma using the Once UI Kit.
2.  **Logic Mapping:** Build the TypeScript logic to handle conditional data field rendering.
3.  **Export Logic:** Integrate `html-to-image` or a similar library for PNG generation.
4.  **Integration Testing:** Verify iFrame behavior and query parameter parsing.
